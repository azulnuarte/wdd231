      <img src="images/flag.jpg" alt="profile" />
      <p>
        The Argentine flag was created by Manuel Belgrano on February 27, 1812,
        during the struggle for independence. It was inspired by the colors of
        the national cockade: light blue and white, symbolizing the sky and the
        fight for freedom. It was hoisted for the first time on the banks of the
        Paraná River, in the city of Rosario. It was officially adopted as the
        national flag in 1816, and in 1818 the sun was added in the center,
        called Sol de Mayo, symbol of freedom and the birth of a new nation.

      <h3>Diameter</h3>
      <p>
        The maximum diameter of Argentina, considering the greatest distance in
        a straight line within the continental territory, is approximately 3,700
        km:<br /><br />
        From north to south (from La Quiaca, Jujuy to Cape San Pío, Tierra del
        Fuego): about 3,650 km.<br />
        From east to west (from the province of Misiones to the Andes mountain
        range in Mendoza or San Juan): about 1,400 km.<br /><br />
        This vast territory makes Argentina the eighth largest country in the
        world and the second largest in South America, after Brazil.
